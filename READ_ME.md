## Sample organizer

### requirements
I chose cascadia code for the font, you can get it here:
https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code
or change it at the top of database_creator.py

you'll need tkinter drag and drop
```pip install tkinterdnd2-universal```

### good to know
currently it only accepts .wav files.
